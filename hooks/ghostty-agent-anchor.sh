# UserPromptSubmit hook: tell the agent where this session lives, and withdraw
# anything still on screen for it.
#
# Submitting a prompt is the cheapest possible proof that the user is back at
# their terminal — free, exact, and it needs no polling.
#
# The tab id is read from the file ghostty-tab-save.sh already wrote, NOT
# sampled from whatever is focused when the agent gets around to the request:
# the agent may drain a second or more later, by which point the user can be
# looking at a different tab, and anchoring a session to the wrong tab both
# withdraws its notification early and sends click-to-jump to someone else's
# session.
#
# Anchor before dismiss so the agent knows this session's tab before it decides
# what to withdraw.
