# Clear (dismiss) a session's on-screen notification.
#
# Two modes:
#   ghostty-notify-clear.sh <session_id>            clear immediately
#   ghostty-notify-clear.sh --watch <session_id>    poll until the user
#                                                   focuses the session's
#                                                   Ghostty tab, then clear
#
# "Clear" means: remove the delivered notification from the screen and
# Notification Center by group ID (alerter --remove / terminal-notifier
# -remove), and kill the blocking alerter process recorded by
# ghostty-notify.sh. A killed alerter produces no action output, which the
# notify hook's dispatch whitelist already treats as "do nothing" — so
# clearing can never fire a phantom tab-jump.
#
# Watch mode is spawned by ghostty-notify.sh right after a notification
# fires. Once you're looking at the session, the alert has done its job:
#   - Cheap frontmost gate first: lsappinfo needs no TCC permission and no
#     scripting; the Ghostty AppleScript query only runs while Ghostty is
#     actually frontmost.
#   - Exact-tab mode when the session's tab_id is known: clears the moment
#     that tab is the selected tab of the frontmost window — including the
#     "already staring at it" case, where the alert is pure noise.
#   - App-level fallback when tab_id is unknown (tmux, unscriptable
#     Ghostty): clears when Ghostty BECOMES frontmost. Rising edge only —
#     if Ghostty was already frontmost when the alert fired, the user may
#     be in a different tab and hasn't seen it yet, so wait for them to
#     leave and come back.
#   - Exits on its own when the alerter concludes (click / timeout), when
#     a newer watcher for the same session takes over, or at
#     NOTIFY_TIMEOUT plus a grace period.
#
# Immediate mode is called (backgrounded) by ghostty-round-reset.sh on
# UserPromptSubmit: a new prompt in the session proves the user is back at
# this tab, so any still-visible notification for it is stale.

# background costs no process spawns at all. It is built locally
# (scripts/build-watcher.sh) and never shipped, so a missing binary just
# leaves the bash loop in charge.
#
# `exec` keeps the PID, so ghostty-notify.sh's spawn and the pidfile
# bookkeeping around it are unaffected, and the session id stays in argv so
# kill_if_matches still recognizes the process. `${VAR-default}` is `-`, not
# `:-`: exporting GHOSTTY_NOTIFY_WATCHER_BIN="" explicitly pins the bash path
# (the regression tests rely on that), while leaving it unset picks the
# sibling build.
