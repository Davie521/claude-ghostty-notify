#
# The bundle is not optional packaging: UNUserNotificationCenter refuses to
# serve a process with no bundle identity, and macOS refuses to grant
# notification authorization at all to a bundle living in a temporary directory
# (verified — a bundle under /private/tmp gets an immediate
# "Notifications are not allowed for this application"). So the bundle is
# assembled under the repo, which is a stable, user-owned location.
#
# Nothing here is committed: see .gitignore.
