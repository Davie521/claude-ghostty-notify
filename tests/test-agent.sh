# Integration test for the resident notification agent.
#
# Drives the REAL binary through the REAL spool transport, using the same
# hooks/agent-common.sh helpers the hooks use, and asserts against the agent's
# own state file and log.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT assert: that a banner appeared. Notification
# delivery needs an authorization grant that only a human can give, so a test
# that depended on it would be unrunnable in CI. The rules that decide WHICH
# notification to withdraw are covered by the NotifyCore suites
# (`swift test --package-path agent`); what is left for a human is the manual
# smoke test — switch away, switch back, watch the banner go.
#
# Anti-false-green: a missing binary is FATAL, not a skip; the agent must prove
# it started (pidfile + log line) before any other assertion runs; and every
# assertion names the exact string it expects rather than "non-empty".
