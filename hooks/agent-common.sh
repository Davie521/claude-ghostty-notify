# Transport is a spool directory: one JSON request per file, published by
# rename so the agent can never read a half-written request. That keeps every
# hook pure bash — no client binary to build, no socket lifetime to manage —
# and lets the integration test drive the whole agent by dropping files.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Callers must already have HOME set.
