/// measured by sending a ping while the dialog was up and getting no answer
/// until it was dismissed. A modal run loop does not service this process's
/// spool watcher or timers, so a setup dialog the user ignored would silently
/// stop every notification — the same failure shape as the synchronous Apple
/// Event that used to block the main actor.
///
/// So: a real window, ordered front, with target/action buttons. The agent keeps
/// draining while it sits there.
